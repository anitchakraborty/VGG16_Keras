# VGG16_Keras
Contents: This repository contains code for the following Keras models:  VGG16-places365 VGG16-hybrid1365 Usage: All architectures are compatible with both TensorFlow and Theano, and upon instantiation the models will be built according to the image dimension ordering set in your Keras configuration file at ~/.keras/keras.json. For instance, if you have set image_dim_ordering=tf, then any model loaded from this repository will get built according to the TensorFlow dimension ordering convention, "Width-Height-Depth".  Pre-trained weights can be automatically loaded upon instantiation (weights='places' argument in model constructor for all image models). Weights are automatically downloaded.
